# Terraform-Mongo

<i>Last year we saw an uptick in development teams moving towards continuous delivery models, and that has only grown since our announcement of the first version of our Terraform Provider. These teams continue to move away from legacy infrastructure management and towards defining their infrastructure as code, creating and modifying what is needed for an application as the code is deployed.

This group has also continued to express a strong preference for HashiCorp Terraform as their infrastructure as code (IaC) service of choice. Because Terraform has support for most of the major cloud providers and services via a plugin-based architecture, we expect that demand to remain strong and continue to grow. That’s why we’ve continued to work with DigitalOnUs to ensure we enable success for those on the cutting edge of continuous deployment with MongoDB Atlas and Terraform.</i>
